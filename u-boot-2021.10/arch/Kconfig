	  Force the each linker list to be aligned to this boundary. This

	  may add padding into the table, thus breaking it.
	  See linker_lists.rst for full details.

config SYS_ARCH
	string
	help
	  This option should contain the architecture name to build the
	  appropriate arch/<CONFIG_SYS_ARCH> directory.
	  All the architectures should specify this option correctly.

config SYS_CPU
	string
	help
	  This option should contain the CPU name to build the correct
	  arch/<CONFIG_SYS_ARCH>/cpu/<CONFIG_SYS_CPU> directory.

	  This is optional.  For those targets without the CPU directory,
	  leave this option empty.

config SYS_SOC
	string
	help
	  This option should contain the SoC name to build the directory
	  arch/<CONFIG_SYS_ARCH>/cpu/<CONFIG_SYS_CPU>/<CONFIG_SYS_SOC>.

	  This is optional.  For those targets without the SoC directory,
	  leave this option empty.

config SYS_VENDOR
	string
	help
	  This option should contain the vendor name of the target board.
	  If it is set and
	  board/<CONFIG_SYS_VENDOR>/common/Makefile exists, the vendor common
	  directory is compiled.
	  If CONFIG_SYS_BOARD is also set, the sources under
	  board/<CONFIG_SYS_VENDOR>/<CONFIG_SYS_BOARD> directory are compiled.

	  This is optional.  For those targets without the vendor directory,
	  leave this option empty.

config SYS_BOARD
	string
	help
	  This option should contain the name of the target board.
	  If it is set, either board/<CONFIG_SYS_VENDOR>/<CONFIG_SYS_BOARD>
	  or board/<CONFIG_SYS_BOARD> directory is compiled depending on
	  whether CONFIG_SYS_VENDOR is set or not.

	  This is optional.  For those targets without the board directory,
	  leave this option empty.

config SYS_CONFIG_NAME
	string
	help
	  This option should contain the base name of board header file.
	  The header file include/configs/<CONFIG_SYS_CONFIG_NAME>.h
	  should be included from include/config.h.

config SYS_DISABLE_DCACHE_OPS
	bool
	help
	 This option disables dcache flush and dcache invalidation
	 operations. For example, on coherent systems where cache
	 operatios are not required, enable this option to avoid them.
	 Note that, its up to the individual architectures to implement
	 this functionality.
